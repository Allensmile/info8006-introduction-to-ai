# Academia vs Private labs

- NIPS remains an *academic* research conference.
- But there is an increasing presence of **strong private research labs**.
    - Google Brain, Google DeepMind, NVidia, Facebook, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, etc.
    - All are aggressively hiring!

# Natural Language Processing

.center.width-70[![](figures/lec10/dog.png)]

- Fundamental goal:
    - Analyze and process human language, broadly, robustly, accurately, ...
- End systems that we want to build:
    - **Ambitious**: speech recognition, machine translation, information extraction, dialog interfaces, question answering, etc.
    - *Modest*: spelling correction, text categorization, etc.

# Probabilistic context-free grammar

- A **grammar** is a collection of rules that defines a *language* as a set of allowable strings of words.
- Probabilistic context-free grammars are grammars such that:
    - production rules do not depend on context (context-free);
    - a probability is assigned to every string (probabilistic).
- Example:
    - $VP \rightarrow Verb [0.7] | VP \, NP [0.3]$
- Let $\xi\_0$ be a language suitable for communication between agents exploring the Wumpus world.


???

R: dont assume they know what is a grammar.

# Lexicon of $\xi\_0$

???

Lexicon = list of allowable words.

---

# Grammar of $\xi\_0$

.center.width-80[![](figures/lec10/grammar.png)]

---

- Unfortunately, this grammar **overgenerates**:
    - It generates sentences that are not grammatical (in English).
    - e.g., "Me go Boston" or "I smell pits wumpus John"
- It also **undergenerates**:
    - Many English sentences are rejected.
    - e.g., "I think the wumpus is smelly."

???

Grammar = compact list of allowable sentences.

# Parse tree

.center.width-80[![](figures/lec10/parse-tree.png)]

---

# Syntactic analysis

.center.width-80[![](figures/lec10/parsing.png)]

- **Parsing** is the process of analyzing a string of words to uncover its phrase structure.
- This process can be carried out efficiently using the CYK algorithm:
    - Imagine a state-action space where actions correspond to production rules.
    - Use A* to search the space efficiently until the string has been compressed to a single item $S$.

???

R: baby step them into the decision process, show backtracking, etc -> analogous to a maze exploration

# Ambiguity

- There may be several distinct parse trees for a given sentence.
- E.g., the sentence "Fall leaves fall and spring leaves spring." admit 4 parse trees:

.center.width-80[![](figures/lec10/ambiguity.png)]

- With A*:
    - Define the cost of a state as the inverse of its probability as defined by the rules applied so far.
    - Estimate the remaining distance using machine learning.
    - With very high probability, the procedure yields the most probable tree.

---

# Learning PCFGs

- A PCFG has many rules, with a probability for each rule.
- **Learning** the grammar might be better than a knowledge engineering approach.
- If we are given a corpus of correctly parsed sentences, the rules and their probability can be estimated directly from this data.
    - E.g., count nodes $S$ and nodes $\[S \[NP ...\]\[VP ...\]\]$ over all trees to estimate the probability of $S \rightarrow  NP \, VP$.
- If we dont have labeled sentences, then we have to learn both the rules and their probability.
    - This is more complicated, but several algorithms exist:
        - Assume (or cross-validate) a number of categories $X, Y, Z, ...$.
        - Assume the grammar includes every possible rule $X \rightarrow Y Z$ or $X \rightarrow word$.
        - Use an expectation-minimization algorithm estimate the probabilities.

---

# Semantic interpretation

.center.width-80[![](figures/lec10/semantic1.png)]

- Semantics can be added to each rule of a grammar.
- The rules obey the principle of **compositional semantics**:
    - The semantics of a phrase is a function of the semantics of the subphrases.
- In general, semantics can be properly defined with *first-order logic*, where nodes are either associated to a logical term, a logical sentence or a predicate.


???

R: better explain the first-order logic relation

# Real language

- A real language like English is difficult to map to a grammar and to a semantics, because of the following reasons:
    - Long-distance dependencies
    - Ambiguities (lexical, syntax, semantic)
    - Metonymies (figure of speech)
    - Metaphors
- Recovering the most probable intended *meaning* is called **disambiguation**. To do disambiguation properly, we need to combine:
    - The *world model*: the likelihood that a proposition occurs in the world.
    - The *mental model*: the likelihood that the speaker forms the intention of communicating some fact to the hearer.
    - The *language model*: the likelihood that a certain string of words will be chosen.
    - The *acoustic model*: the likelihood that a certain sequence of sounds will be generated.
- Combining perfectly all these pieces together remains an **open problem**!

# Eliza

.grid[
.col-2-3[
- *Eliza* is one of the earliest instances of a **chatterbot** (Weizenbaum, 1964).
- Led to a long line of chatterbots.
- How does it work?
    - Trivial NLP: string match and substitution.
    - Trivial knowledge: tiny script / response database.
    - Example: matching "I remember \_\_\_" results in "Do you often think of \_\_\_?"

# Machine translation

- Translate text from one language to another, while *preserving the intended meaning*.
- Recombines fragments of example translations.

    - What fragments? [Learning to translate]
    - How to make efficient? [Fast translation search]

# Statistical machine translation

To translate a sentence in English ($e$) into French ($f$), we seek the strings of words $f^\*$ that maximizes

$$f^\* = \arg\max\_f P(f|e) = \arg\max\_f P(e|f)P(f)$$

- $P(f)$ is the *language model*
- $P(e|f)$ is the *translation model* (from French to English)
